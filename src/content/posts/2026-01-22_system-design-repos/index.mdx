These two repositories are outstanding, extremely well-organised, and among the best resources available for **system design interview preparation** and **scalable system architecture learning**.

They cover both **foundational concepts** and **real-world design problems**, with clear explanations, diagrams, and practical trade-offs that reflect how systems are built in production.

### Why these repositories are valuable

- Clear breakdown of **core system design concepts** (scalability, reliability, availability, consistency)
- Step-by-step walkthroughs of **real interview-style design problems**
- Well-structured sections with diagrams and examples
- Focus on **trade-offs** rather than “one correct answer”
- Useful both for **interview preparation** and **day-to-day architectural thinking**
